              <ul>
                <br>
                <li>Develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based agent to play Checkers using Python object-oriented programming, Pytorch, and OpenAI Gym <br>
                    ( <a href="https://github.com/qyy752457002/Explainable-AI/tree/main/Python-Checkers-AI">My Fancy MCTS model </a> ðŸ˜Š)
                </li>
                <li>Establish event logs reflecting agent's behaviors using Python Pandas and NumPy according to policies executed by agent</li>
                <li>Generate process models based on event logs using 3 process mining algorithm (alpha miner, evolutional tree miner, inductive miner) and evaluate models' performance with accuracy and F1-measure</li>
                <li>Apply process models to answer 2 questions: 1. why does agent execute action A instead of action B? 2. what will be agent's next action?</li>
